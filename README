# restic-cli

This is a cli extension to [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic). It enables automated backup through cron-jobs, as well as status tracking through a 'bashrc' script.

## Installation
'git clone' this repository and run 'restic-cli update', in order to install the latest version of restic through github's releases (The script will download the 'linux-amd64' version, if otherwise required please modify the 'update' function). If your 'restic' repo was not initialized yet, please use the 'init-repo' command. Make sure you configured your repository and its credentials (see the [restic manual](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html) for that) in the 'restic.conf' file. 

Finally define a local key for the client through the 'init-client', using the repository password.
